# M711Dimension
An incomplete multiplayer sandbox game written in python (uses pygame).

#Features:
-Has its own API (allows server side scripts in lua)
-Masterlist + (an incomplete) game launcher

Just saying this isn't an actual game (At least not in this state) this is just some huge mess I've created while messing around with python.
