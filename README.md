# M711Dimension
An incomplete multiplayer sandbox game written in python (uses pygame).

# Features:
-Has its own API (allows server side scripts in lua)

-Masterlist + (an incomplete) game launcher

Just saying this isn't an actual game (At least not in this state) this is just some huge mess I've created while messing around with python.

The project has been canceled since march 2020 and I have no plans to work on it again.
